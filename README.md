## About

Emory Hacks, presented by PROJECT Emory, is a hackathon hosted at
Emory University. We are committed to bringing hundreds of students
together for an intensive 36-hour hackathon where innovation comes
to life. Participants build cutting-edge applications, websites, and
digital tools while learning from industry professionals through
hands-on workshops and mentorship. Whether you&apos;re a first-time
coder or a seasoned developer, join us to push your creative and
technical boundaries in this dynamic weekend of building and
collaboration.
